USER INFO:
This program is a shell that can run interactively or can process a list
of given commands. 

An example list of batch commands is given.

This was created in a virtual Ubuntu x86 environment, and is not intended
to run outside of a unix-based system. 

INSTRUCTIONS:
Provided makefile creates mush objects and executable by calling:
make
make mush

Execute program from command line:
$DIR/mush

Alternatively, call mush with a list of commands to do batch processing:
$DIR/mush commands

Only supports command lines up to 512 chars in length.

Weird behaviour regarding "ls Makefile mush > test":
      Command fails with either "corrupted size vs. prev_size" or realloc 
	  claims the pointer isn't already alloc-ed. It will work, but failure
	  seems random. I've confirmed the pointer exists before realloc is 
	  called by stepping through. As for the corrupted size issue, research 
	  says it happens when overwriting alloc-ed memory, but I had trouble 
	  finding where it occurs. My original parseline didn't have this 
	  issue, and a majority of the code was reused except for removing 
	  excess mallocs and adding a line to deal with the memory leak. 
	  I even tried adding these back to no avail.

      I came back to really sus out why it isn't working, and it runs fine in
      valgrind.
